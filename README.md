The largest layout is modeled after the original comp in aspect, with 40% of the right side for the photo and 60% of the left for the menu. Instead of containing all menu buttons in one flex wrap, three separate <divs> are used with the appropriate number of menu buttons. Being able to utilize groups of buttons in smaller sections allowed more flexibility across the other screen sizes.
